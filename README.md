This is a capstone project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This case study explores a real-world public dataset from Divvy, a bike-sharing company located in Chicago. The system provides bicycles in a city-wide network of docking stations which can be accessed by annual members or casual users who purchase a single-ride or day pass. Over four million rides were taken between June 2020 and July 2021.

This case study will explore the differences in bike riding habits between members and casual riders that can help the company derives a conversion strategy. The data cleaning process was done using R, and visualization with Tableau.
