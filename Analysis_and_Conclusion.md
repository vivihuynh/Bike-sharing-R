# Analysis
Members have consistent riding activity and trip length during the weekdays particularly in the middle of the week, and slow down toward the weekend. Casuals showed very little activity during the weekdays, but increased by more than 200% on the weekends. The average trip length for casuals is 24 minutes, almost double that of members at 13 minutes. 

Casuals are making less trips than members, but their trip duration is longer.

For both groups, afternoon is the most popular riding time and night the least popular. Riding activity peaks for members at 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., while casual riding activity peaks only at 5:00 P.M. 

Summer is the most popular season for both groups, 35.75% of all rides for members and 47.04% for casuals. Ride activities are low in the winter months. Possible reasons are harsh Chicago weather, less tourists, etc. Top visited locations for casuals are also mainly tourist destinations. Therefore, members are most likely 9-5 office workers while casuals demographic range from family, to tourists and students.

 # Strategy
The best time to launch a conversion marketing campaign is during summer. It can targets the demographic with strategies such as:
* Student discount
* Family discount
* Alternative and more affordable pass with limitation (such as weekend usage only)

Additionally, social media should be used to encourage bike sharing as an environmentally friendly form of transportation as well as the health benefits of biking.
