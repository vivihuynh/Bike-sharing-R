# Background
 Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic offers flexibility in its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
 
 For this case study, I will plays the role of a junior data analyst for Cyclistic. 
 
 Note: Cyclistic is a fictional company just for the purpose doing a capstone project under Google's Data Analytic course.
